## The Process
*These are the steps/to dos I went through as I coded. They are listed in order of completion.* 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] only animals with greater or equal power may eat (does not account for mouse and elephant exception) 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] all pieces currently cannot go on water
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] mouse can swim in water
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] tigers and lions can now jump over water (does not account for mouse yet)
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] mouse in water means lion and tiger cannot jump water
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] a player can't move into its own den (all pieces now -- dapat)
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] mouse can capture elephant
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] elphant can't capture mouse
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] trap functionalites (works for enemy traps only)
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I'm deciding that elephant still cant eat mouse tho, and mouse can still capture elphant)
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] A mouse on the river may not capture an elephant or another mouse on land
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] A mouse on the river may capture another mouse on the river
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] A mouse on land may not capture a mouse on the river
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] switches turns already
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] no win state (reach Den -- does not matter if all oppenets pieces are gone, must reach den) 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if all pieces for both players gone, game over <-- don't think this is possible
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] does not end game (part of win state)
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] side panel section of jpanel is still empty
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ X ] the win is pretty spaghetti as of rn, make it cleaner but it works as is

<br>

## Goals For This Exercise
1. Re-familiarize myself with Java
2. Practice OOP
3. Stretch my design muscles
4. Improve upon my earlier work (both in terms of code cleanliness and logic)
